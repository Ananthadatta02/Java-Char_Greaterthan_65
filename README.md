# Java-Char_Greaterthan_65
This Java program takes a character input from the user and checks if its ASCII value is greater than 65. It uses a Scanner for input, extracts the first character, and compares it to ASCII value 65, printing whether the ASCII value is greater than 65 or not based on the comparison.
